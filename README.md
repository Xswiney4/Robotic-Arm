## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a robotic arm that can be controlled via servo motors, using inverse kinematics for precise movement. The arm is designed to be flexible and capable of performing tasks in a 3D space.

## Key Features

- **Decoupling Inverse Kinematics**: Solves for joint angles by breaking the problem into two simpler problems. Allows me to come at a point in 3D space with a specific orientaiton.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Uses PCA9685 to control the servo motors and set precise angles.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured to be easily modifiable and expandable, allowing future additions such as more complex joints or different end effectors.
